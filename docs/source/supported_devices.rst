Supported Devices
==================

Note: These links are tracking links with Amazon or Roborock. This allows us to get some analytics and helps us get
'negotiation' power with Roborock. We would like to be able to open a channel of communication with Roborock, and
getting information like this is a great first step.

Note, I have only added links to the new devices, older devices are no longer sold directly by roborock, so to buy them
you have to find them used.

Roborock has recently added two other categories of devices, handheld vacuums, and washing machines.
Neither are supported at this time.

There are plans to support the handheld ones, but it uses a newer version of the api that I am still trying to reverse
engineer.
